# a-word

Explain the essence of things in one sentence

## product

- Users are willing to pay if the product really helps them solve the problem.

- The success or failure of the product has nothing to do with the amount of work you put in.

## project

- Great projects only had a few people at first.

## learn

- It’s easy to learn, but hard to use well.

## technology

- Data is the key. If you choose the right data structure and organize it properly, then the algorithm can often be reflected naturally. Data structure is the core of programming, algorithm is not.
